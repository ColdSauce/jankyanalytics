# Janky Analytics

## Warning: This is a work in progress.

Super basic and simple analytics that just works. 

### Getting Started

Clone this Github repo to a folder you have on your server, install Flask, and run `python analytics.py`. 


Add this to your website's HTML:

```html
<img src="your_ip:your_port" style="display: none">
```

To see the requests coming in at real time, you can do the following if you're in the working directory.

```bash
tail -f logfile.txt
```

### Next Steps

I created this as a 20 minute long hack to get analytics on my website but thought it might be useful to make this free and open source. 
The most important thing for me is to make the user experience nice. Something as simple as Google Analytics but a lot less evil.
